        <p>I would like to start by saying I have never understood english well. Math, its just a piece of pi. Social studies, easier than finding gold in the 1849 gold rush. Even in any science class, easier than combinding sodium and chloride to make salt. My struggle, reading a passage of text and trying to figure out what the author meant like I could read his mind?</p>
